We cannot benefit from the use of iterators without changing the elements of
the vector to which the iterators are pointing. In order to assure that the
vector passed as an argument to median is not changed, one could pass
immutable iterators, but in order to compute the median one would need to
sort a copy of the range delimited by the iterators. This would clearly spoil
any looked for performance improvement.
